🚀 Embedded Systems & Electronics Design Portfolio

This repository is a collection of hardware, firmware, and PCB design projects I have built across the past year.
It is organized as a monorepo, where each folder represents a separate embedded-systems project, including Raspberry Pi HATs, sensor boards, analog filters, diagnostic tools, and custom control modules.

This portfolio is part of my application to the University of California, Berkeley, and showcases my experience in:

Embedded systems design

PCB layout & electronics hardware

Microcontroller programming

Signal processing

IoT sensors & digital interfaces

Electronics testing & validation

📁 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository is a standalone hardware/firmware project.
